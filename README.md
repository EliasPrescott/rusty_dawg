Learning about [Directed Acyclic Word Graphs (DAWGs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton) by implementing them in Rust for dictionary word retrieval and search. For search, I am traversing the graph and calculating the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) from the search term.
